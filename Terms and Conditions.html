-Here you are paying only the rental of the vehicle for the duration that you have selected, other than that, the person who visits you to rent out the car (Car owner) will be charging a Refundable Deposit as a Security when handing over the vehicle to you, and the amount will be varied depending on the vehicle, how ever the maximum it could be is 1,100 USD and minimum it could be is 275 USD , so you wil be asked to pay an amount in between 275 USD - 1,100 USD depending on the vehicle, and you can not refuse to pay it, in such case we will have to cancel the booking and the rental you have payed will not be refunded. The security deposit will be used to cover up damages if any, which can be covered with that amount, and if the damage goes beyond the security deposit, we will be claiming the insurance (vehicles are fully insured) from the insurance company. (please be kindly understand that, we can not claim insurances for minor damages, if so we will have to claim insurance after each day we rent out a car, because unfortunate scratches are so common, thus we will not have time to do anything other than filling insurance company documents, and also claiming insurances regularly will affect us so badly in a way sometimes we will not be able to claim for a Major damage, if in case we have regularly claimed insurance unnecessarily, hope it is understandable.)<br><br><br>

-In case of addition of an extra day to the package, you SHOULD inform the company beforehand, atleast a day (24 hours) before the time that you should have returned the vehicle to the office, if not we will be charging a 50% of your refundable deposit for violating the agreements (this is because,  the same vehicle might have already reserved by another client from next day onwards, where we have to hand over the vehicle to some other client, soon after a  clean-up, when your booking duration is over ,in case if you will delay handing over the vehile on scheduled day, we will be in trouble in finding another vehicle to the next client and we will have to face a lot of trouble on convincing him/her the fact that the person who rented out the vehicle has not returned the vehicle on due date violating the agreements, we hope you also will not like to face to a similar situation , of which we will not be able to handover the vehicle that you have payed for, just because of another individuals despute acts, so do not let someone else fell into the same situation.)<br><br><br>
